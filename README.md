# Currency_Converter

This project is designed for converting one currency to another. In this project, I have utilized the **EasyGUI** and **requests** modules.

- **EasyGUI** is used to create a graphical user interface, making the application user-friendly.
- The **requests** module is employed to collect data via URL and API calls.

The API for exchange rates is sourced from [ExchangeRate-API](https://app.exchangerate-api.com/dashboard). To get this project up and running, simply replace the provided API key with your own.
